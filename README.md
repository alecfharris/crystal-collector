# Crystals Collector

*The crystals needed to have a random value and there needed to be a random goal. In order to get to that random value,
the crystals could be clicked, adding to the score. A matching score results in a win.

*This was accomplished by using Javascript functions to randomly generate a number for each crystal
and for the total. 
*Once the number was determined, JQuery was used to make on click events and to increase the score
by the number clicked.
