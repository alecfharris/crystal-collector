# Crystal Collector

## Description
Crystal Collector is a browser based game in which users click crystals to achieve a specific score. Each crystal has a randomly assigned number value that is added to the score each time it is clicked. JQuery click events are used to ensure that once a crystal is clicked, the score is added to the total.

## How to Play
When you load the page, a score goal will be displayed. Click the crystals to determine the values of each crystal and then plot how to reach the score goal with the values of each crystal.
